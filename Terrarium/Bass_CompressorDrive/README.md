Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Range of controls needs review. Good tones are achievable but hard to dial in as it stands
Using a state variable filter although allows me to get lp and hp all at once, may be scooping my mids
Perhaps the overdrive stages dry signal should just be the unfiltered compressor stage output?
